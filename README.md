COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis Using Medical Images: Deep Learning–Based Transfer Learning Approach

Abstract
Abstract
Background:
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, remains a global health concern due to its high transmissibility and evolving variants. Although vaccination efforts and therapeutic advancements have mitigated disease severity, emerging mutations continue to challenge diagnostics and containment strategies. As of mid-February 2025, global test positivity has risen to 11%, marking the highest level in over 6 months, despite widespread immunization efforts. Newer variants demonstrate enhanced host cell binding, increasing both infectivity and diagnostic complexity.

Objective:
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of deep transfer learning in delivering a rapid, accurate, and mutation-resilient COVID-19 diagnosis from medical imaging, with a focus on scalability and accessibility.

Methods:
An automated detection system was developed using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, including VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group network-16 layers), ResNet50 (residual network-50 layers), ConvNeXtTiny (convolutional next-tiny), MobileNet (mobile network), NASNetMobile (neural architecture search network-mobile version), and DenseNet121 (densely connected convolutional network-121 layers), to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images.

Results:
Among all the models evaluated, DenseNet121 emerged as the best-performing architecture for COVID-19 diagnosis using X-ray and CT images. It achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, with a precision of 96.9%, a recall of 98.9%, an F1-score of 97.9%, and an area under the curve score of 99.8%, indicating a high degree of consistency and reliability in detecting both positive and negative cases. The confusion matrix showed minimal false positives and false negatives, underscoring the model’s robustness in real-world diagnostic scenarios. Given its performance, DenseNet121 is a strong candidate for deployment in clinical settings and serves as a benchmark for future improvements in artificial intelligence–assisted diagnostic tools.

Conclusions:
The study results underscore the potential of artificial intelligence–powered diagnostics in supporting early detection and global pandemic response. With careful optimization, deep learning models can address critical gaps in testing, particularly in settings constrained by limited resources or emerging variants.
